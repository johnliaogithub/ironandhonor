next release: 
 - make the journal so that it adds on after/before every fight scene
 - camp scene red soldiers should go to end no matter if the enemy soldiers are present or not
 - make dying animations move downwards
 - remove feet from spitesheets with errors: thrusting
 - make archers shoot arrows from afar
 - prevent soldiers from all targeting one soldier or mc
 - prevent soldiers from stacking
 - draw dead troops behind
 - sounds and music
 - health bar not good: maybe changing width of health bar border should be sufficient
 - work on archer now
 - overlap prevention
 - remove random generation when on ladder
 - add pan over
 - instructions
 - problem: wait too long on camp instruction, troops start spwanings
 - problem with generator timing
 - baseunit.load should be in game init, maybe do asynchronously
 - bug: entering into next scene will cause the interaction to pass
 - when interaction: everyone should pause (maybe work on this after submit essay)
 - might have to change interaction system or combine with custom scene
 - healing should be delayed after last attack (then, maybe allow health to carry on?)
 - add transition between field and wall
 - make a better first page using the sprite images
 - maybe indiate that enter goes to next
 - game is laggy on itch.io for some reason
